## Learning goals

### Overview of Data Science Tools  

In this module, you will learn about the different types and categories of tools that data scientists use and popular examples of each. You will also become familiar with Open Source,  Cloud-based,  and Commercial options for data science tools.

Learning Objectives:
- Describe the components of a Data Scientist's toolkit and list various tool categories
- List examples of Open Source, Commercial, and Cloud-based tools in various categories


### Languages of Data Science  

This module will bring awareness about the criteria determining which language you should learn. You will learn the benefits of Python, R, SQL, and other common languages such as Java, Scala, C++, JavaScript, and Julia. You will explore how you can use these languages in Data Science. You will also look at some sites for more information about the languages. 

Learning Objectives:
- Identify the criteria and roles for determining the language to learn.
- Identify the users and benefits of Python.
- Identify the users and uses of the R language.
- Define SQL elements and list their benefits.
- Review languages such as Java, Scala, C++, JavaScript, and Julia.
- List the global communities for connecting with other users.


### Packages, APIs, Data Sets and Models  

This module will give you in-depth knowledge of different libraries, APIs, dataset sources and models used by data scientist.

Learning Objectives
- List examples of the various libraries: scientific, visualization, machine learning, and deep learning.
- Define REST API to request and respond.
- Describe data sets and sources of data.
- Explore open data sets on the Data Asset eXchange.
- Describe how to use a learning model to solve a problem.
- List the tasks that a data scientist needs to perform to build a model.
- Explore ML models in the Model Learning eXchange.


### Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterLab 

This module introduces the Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab. You will learn how to work with different kernels and the basic Jupyter architecture. In addition, you will identify the tools in an Anaconda Jupyter environment. Finally, the module overviews cloud-based Jupyter environments and their data science features. 

Learning Objectives:
- Describe how to use the notebooks in JupyterLab.
- Describe how to work in a notebook session.
- Describe the basic Jupyter architecture.
- Describe how to work with kernels.
- Identify tools in Anaconda Jupyter environments.
- Describe cloud-based Jupyter environments and their data science features.


### RStudio and GitHub 

This module will start with an introduction to R and RStudio and will end up with Github usage. You will learn about the different R visualization packages and how to create visual charts using the plot function.

Further in the module, you will develop the essential conceptual and hands-on skills to work with Git and GitHub. You will start with an overview of Git and GitHub, creating a GitHub account and a project repository, adding files, and committing your changes using the web interface. Next, you will become familiar with Git workflows involving branches, pull requests (PRs), and merges. You will also complete a project at the end to apply and demonstrate your newly acquired skills. 

Learning Objectives:
- Describe R capabilities and RStudio environment.
- Use the inbuilt R plot function.
- Explain version control and describe the Git and GitHub environment.
- Describe the purpose of source repositories and explain how GitHub satisfies the needs of a source repository.
- Create a GitHub account and a project repository.
- Demonstrate how to edit and upload files in GitHub.
- Explain the purpose of branches and how to merge changes.
