!!! note "Work in Progress"

    Please note that the notebook you are referring to is currently a work in progress and may continue to be under development for an extended period. This ongoing process ensures that the content remains up-to-date and relevant, reflecting the latest information and research. As such, some sections may be incomplete or subject to change.


## About the notebooks

Within these pages lies a collection of notes, code snippets, and Jupyter notebooks that serve as a testament to my journey through the ever-evolving landscape of technology. This notebook is not just a repository of information, but a reflection of the continuous learning process, embodying the principles of iteration, innovation, and integration that are at the heart of these disciplines. From the foundational concepts of programming to the intricate nuances of Python syntax, and the analytical depths of data science, each section is crafted to enhance understanding and proficiency.

**Python** programming, with its elegant syntax and powerful libraries, serves as a cornerstone of this compendium, enabling the crafting of solutions that range from the simple to the sublime. **Data science**, the beacon of modern decision-making, is explored through analytical narratives and case studies, showcasing the transformative power of data in extracting meaningful patterns and predictions. Accompanying these written notes are **Jupyter notebooks**, interactive canvases that blend code, visuals, and text to bring concepts to life serving as a testament to the problems tackled and the solutions discovered

This notebook is both a reflection of my dedication to continuous learning and a resource for fellow enthusiasts to delve into the depths of these subjects.


## Disclaimer

The concept of sharing personal notes publicly is a fascinating approach to creativity and transparency. It allows for an unfiltered glimpse into my thought processes and personal growth as an individual. This invites you to observe the often messy, non-linear path of my personal development and idea generation. If you can resonate with this open, exploratory approach, these notes can be a treasure trove of insights and inspiration.

For others, the unstructured nature of these notes may not align with their preferences, and that's perfectly acceptable. Whether you choose to dive into these notes or not, their very existence is an invitation to embrace transparency and authenticity in your own creative endeavors. And if the outdated musings are not someone's cup of tea, well, the exit is just a click away â€“ no hard feelings!


## How the notebooks were built

These notebooks were built using [MkDocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)

!!! info "Theme modification"

    The theme has been modified to have a solarized based color scheme. Also
    some the table format has been modified to match the tables coming from
    pandas output in the converted jupyter notebooks
